# Retro_RPG (proof of concept)
(Just a bit of fun)

Paying homage to the 8 bit legends of RPG such as Wizardry, Bards Tale and Rogue. 
This verson is a simple,open source, no fuss turn based RPG, that can be used as a framework to build and take in whatever direction you wish

This version:
No fancy game engines, just..... C++, SDL, and OpenGl

Mainly proof concept code to get the project started

UPDATE 9/Dec/2024
I am now retired so hoping to actually have time to develop this !
